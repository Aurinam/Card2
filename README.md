# Animated Debit Dard using Raw HTML and CSS
### Application of flipping animation 


This is an animated portrayal of a MasterCard debit card. In normal conditions, it displays the front side of the card. On hovering the mouse cursor on the card, the card gets flipped. The back side of the card is visible then. 


This project utilizes some special CSS properties and values. ie.
+ `transform-style: preserve-3d;`
+ `backdrop-filter: blur(30px);`
+ `background: repeating-linear-gradient(#fff, #fff 3px, #efefef 0px, #efefef 9px);`

This project is inspired by CodingLab. The CodingLab's version of this project can be found on their channel on YouTube.

Feel free to make any modification to the program.
